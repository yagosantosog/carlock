    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure is designed to support the CarLock landing page application, focusing on leads, testimonials, and pricing plans. It prioritizes simplicity and security. Leads are stored in a flat collection for easy access. Testimonials and Pricing Plans are stored in their own collections to allow for independent management and querying.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** There is no authorization required for leads. Testimonials and Pricing Plans will likely be managed by admin users through a separate CMS, so we are not including user-based security rules for them right now.\n\n**QAPs:** The structure supports listing all testimonials and pricing plans, allowing for easy display on the landing page."
